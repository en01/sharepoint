<p>Project Description<br />This is my personal effort to add some custom actions and a web part to my SharePoint 2010 site. This is a sandboxed solution.<br /><br />Essentially, this project includes two key components.<br />1. A custom action<br />2. A web part<br /><br />The custom action is available from the Site Actions menu and directs the user to an "Admin" page. This admin page is not part of this code and needs to be created separately.<br /><br />The admin page is like a home page for admin utilities; it only consists of links to other pages. In my site, I created a separate page that houses the web part and the admin page simply links to that.<br /><br />The web part itself simply discovers the current master page applied to the top-level SPWeb in the SPSite and applies it to all SPWeb objects within the SPSite. This is something that's not possible out of the box in a hosted SharePoint 2010 environment. The alternative to this is to manually edit the master page of each site or copy/paste from the top-level SPWeb to each of the other SPWeb objects with SharePoint Designer 2010. That's an approach that will work, but is altogether quite tedious; this solution is supposed to make the that effort easier.</p>
